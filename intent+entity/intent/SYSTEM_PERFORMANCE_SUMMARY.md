### 🚀 **Usage Instructions**

#### Training Pipeline:

```bash
# 1. Prepare enhanced data
python prepare_intent_data.py

# 2. Train the model
python simple_ml_trainer.py

# 3. Test predictions
python predict_intent.py
```

#### Sample Predictions:

- "What courses are available?" → **Course_list** (57.9% confidence)
- "How much does Computer Engineering cost?" → **Course_fee** (57.5% confidence)
- "Does SEC have hostel?" → **Hostel_availability** (97.2% confidence)
- "Tell me about admission process" → **Admission_process** (82.4% confidence)
